# Zirconium
[Zirconium](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zirconium) is an two-dimensional esoteric programming language which functions akin to a space strategy game.

## Running
Clone and install [CBQN](https://github.com/dzaima/CBQN/)

Run `./bqn Zirconium.bqn`.

## Ideas
It works on the basis of creating and manipulating stations to dispatch drones via tunnels during every tick of time, which corresponds to a move.

Some documentation is written in `Zirconium.bqn`, however a full specification can be seen on the esolangs wiki: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zirconium
